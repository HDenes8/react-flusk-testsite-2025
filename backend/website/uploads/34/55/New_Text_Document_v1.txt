**Apex Legends Beginners Guide

*What is Apex Legends?

Apex legends is a First Person Shooter Battle Royale. It stands out of it's piers since unlike the biggest Battle Royale such as Fortnite and PUBG it is a Hero Shooter. Meaning you have different legends to choose from to play before every match. Apex Legends also came from an another game called Titan Fall and has many links to that game. Both in lore and design choices for the weapons and maps. And since Titan Fall is the origin of Apex many of the beloved movement techs have been scooped up from it and put into the game we love.


*How it feels to play Apex Legends?

The game is nice and fluid. You start of in a dropship just like in any other BR game and can choose where to land. After landing you can gather yourself weapons, attachments, healing items and fight to be the last team standing. The game itself is not as tactical such your CS:GO, Valorant. It has more of a chaotic lower ranked SIEGE feel. Where people are just running around trying to kill others. Unlike these games the time to kill is slower. (3 shot mastiff) There is no one hit headshot mechanic that would drop you instantly out of the fight. (rampart kraber)
But you may ask: But dear youtuber... What does this game have that makes it stand out?
And my answer would be to that very specific question:
It is a very good question to ask. And not just because you would help me to transition to the next segment that is...


*Apex Legends... and it's movement

Apex is a strange kid amongst the others. It has quite a different feel to it than other BRs. And that comes from *movement*. In Apex Legends if you don't know at least the very basics of sliding and slide jumping you are almost a sitting duck compared to others. The game also have so called *movement legends* such as Octane, Horizon and Pathfinder to name a few. These legends have tactical abilities that are used to move in space more effectively. For example, running faster, levitating upward, climbing on walls. 
But in order to use most the movement techs in the game you don't have to play any specific character. Of course they can enhance the effect of certain ones but not mandatory.


*What are movement techs?

 These are based different inputs in different places to get the edge over your opponents in a fight. The most common of these are the basic slide jump. You can activate it by sliding and jumping at the end of the jump. Simple... right?
Now let's see a bit more nuanced tech. The wall jump; with this one you *run* then *slide* towards a wall *jump* at the right time to be just close enough, then *don't put any inputs* attach to the wall, then *jump* as soon as you attached.
Okey.. maybe it was a bit sudden.. let's see one that should be easier.
The Super Glide. All you have to do is *climb on a ledge* and when just arrived at the top press your crouch button. Simple right? Well.. maybe. The only thing is that you need to hit it in a single frame window. Yes... in a single frame that you see depending on your refresh rate 60 or more in a second. (a bit frustrated voice)


*How it REALLY feels like to play Apex Legends

Apex Legends is... hard. Not like the average player after looking at Loba from behind. But in terms of starting out as a new player. Of course you don't need to know these movement techs to play... Right? Right?
Well... fundamentally no. In order to play the game you need to be able to move and shoot and most players can do that. However having the knowledge that these are a possibility is already going to improve your survivability.
Simple example with a relatively easy and frequently used movement tech: the wall jump.
It might have looked very hard or very simple based on who you ask... but after a bit of practice wall jumping consistently is not as bad as you will think where first trying it out.
But the example... 
You are Timmy (insert timmy)
You started to play your new game and are walking around looting, looking at the scenery. Then you here your dear teammate's ping "enemies" you look in the direction readying your weapon.
You see a short character running towards you.
You aim and start shooting
When you do the short figure initiate a slide then jumps into a wall, then flies towards you way faster than running
You freak out, miss the full mag and then shoots you in the face with a shotgun.

How would knowing that is was a wall jump save you? In the way you would not shit your pants when it happens since you expect a Wraith main to jump into your face with a wall jump if it's possible.

**Apex Legends Beginners Guide

*What is Apex Legends?

Apex Legends is a First-Person Shooter Battle Royale, but with a twist—it’s also a Hero Shooter. This means you pick from a roster of Legends, each with unique abilities, before every match. Think Overwatch meets PUBG, but with more chaos and sliding.
The game comes from Titanfall, so it borrows not only lore but also design elements, like weapons and maps. And if you’ve ever played Titanfall, you’ll recognize where Apex got its DNA—especially when it comes to movement.


*How It Feels to Play Apex Legends

At first glance, Apex feels smooth and fluid. You drop from the dropship, pick your landing spot, loot weapons, attachments, and healing items, then battle it out to be the last squad standing.
It’s not as tactical as Valorant or CS:GO, where every corner hides an instant death. No, Apex gives you room to fight back. The time-to-kill (TTK) is longer, so you won’t get one-shot out of nowhere, right?
(Show clip of Rampart Kraber headshot: “Just kidding. This happens.”)
But Apex isn’t just about surviving—it’s about thriving in chaos. The question is: What makes Apex stand out from other BRs?


*Apex Legends... and Its Movement

Here’s where Apex gets interesting. Unlike other Battle Royales, Apex’s movement mechanics make it feel like an adrenaline-fueled playground. Sliding, wall-jumping, and zip-lining aren't just flashy—they’re essential.
There are even specific movement Legends like Octane, Horizon, and Pathfinder, whose abilities make moving around even more fun (and terrifying for your enemies).
But here’s the kicker: you don’t need a movement Legend to learn movement tech. Most mechanics, like slide-jumping or wall-bouncing, are universal—though pulling them off is another story entirely.
What Are Movement Techs?
Movement techs are techniques players use to get an edge in fights by manipulating their momentum. Let’s go through a few examples:
    Slide Jump: Run, crouch to slide, and jump at the end for a speed boost. Simple, right?
    Wall Jump: Run, slide into a wall, jump to attach, release inputs, then jump off. Sounds fun... until you actually       try it.
    Super Glide: Climb to a ledge and press crouch at exactly the right frame—because why not make it soul-crushingly precise?
(Frustrated) “Sure, it’s easy. Just hit the button within 1/60th of a second. What could go wrong?”


*How It REALLY Feels to Play Apex Legends

Apex Legends is... hard. Not hard like figuring out how not to stare at Loba’s backside. Hard like learning calculus while someone throws grenades at you.
Let’s be real: you don’t need movement techs to play Apex. But the moment you realize they exist, it feels like playing without them is missing half the game.
Picture this:
You’re Timmy. You’re new. You’re looting, enjoying the scenery, when suddenly your teammate pings: “Enemies here!”
You ready your weapon, aiming at the short figure running toward you. Then, before you can react, they slide, wall-jump, and close the gap faster than your brain can process.
(Cue clip of Timmy missing every shot while Wraith mains wall-jump into his face with a Mastiff.)
Knowing what a wall-jump is wouldn’t save you from that. But at least you wouldn’t need new pants.


*The Dark Side of Apex Legends

Here’s the truth: Apex is one of the most satisfying yet brutal games to get into. The skill ceiling is sky-high, and starting out feels like everyone else is playing chess while you’re learning checkers.
But that’s also what makes Apex rewarding. Every match teaches you something new. Every wall-jump you pull off, every squad wipe you secure, feels like a victory against the odds.
So yes, Apex is hard—but it’s that challenge that keeps us coming back. And when you finally master it, you’ll realize: the chaos is what makes it fun.

// "Yes, Apex Legends is hard, (Not like a player mesmerized by Loba's... assets.) but that's what makes every win feel so rewarding. Because when you get better, when you outplay someone with a wall jump, or land your first Kraber headshot, it’s worth every frustrating moment."

(End with a montage of "epic" plays and funny fails.)


-"chaotic fun," show someone enjoying a gunfight or being one-clipped by an R-99 with zero chance to react.
-Similarly, for movement: show both a beginner struggling and a pro seamlessly pulling off advanced tech.

**Apex Legends Beginners Guide

*What is Apex Legends?

Apex Legends is a First-Person Shooter Battle Royale, but with a twist—it’s also a Hero Shooter. This means you pick from a roster of Legends, each with unique abilities, before every match. Think Overwatch meets PUBG, but with more chaos and sliding.
What sets Apex apart is its roots. It comes from Titanfall, and you can feel that DNA in its lore, weapons, and maps. But more importantly, it brought over some of the best parts of Titanfall’s movement mechanics, creating a game that’s less of a battlefield and more of a playground—one where everyone can express themselves through movement.
How It Feels to Play Apex Legends
At first, Apex feels smooth and exhilarating. You drop from the sky, pick a landing spot, and start looting. The game encourages fast-paced fights with weapons, attachments, and healing items scattered everywhere. Victory goes to the last squad standing.
Unlike more tactical shooters like Valorant or CS:GO, Apex thrives in chaos. It’s not about perfect positioning; it’s about reacting to the madness. The time-to-kill (TTK) is longer, so fights feel fairer—you won’t get deleted instantly... or so you think.
(Show clip of Rampart’s Kraber headshot)
"Okay, except when that happens. But hey, that’s rare, right?"
And that’s the magic of Apex: it combines the tension of survival with the unpredictability of a chaotic, adrenaline-filled playground. But what if the playground required you to do quantum physics just to swing on the monkey bars?


*Apex Legends... and Its Movement

Here’s where Apex separates itself from other Battle Royales. Movement in Apex isn’t just a feature—it’s an identity. The fluidity of sliding, wall-jumping, and zip-lining isn’t just about getting around; it’s about style, speed, and outplaying your opponents.
There are even specific movement Legends like Octane, Horizon, and Pathfinder, who make the chaos even more dynamic. Want to zoom around faster? Use Octane. Want to defy gravity? Pick Horizon. Want to swing around like Spider-Man? Pathfinder has you covered.
But here’s the thing: you don’t need these Legends to learn movement tech. Most mechanics, like slide-jumping and wall-bouncing, are available to every character. And while they look easy when pros do them, they can feel like trying to perform a magic trick with your hands tied.
What Are Movement Techs?
Movement techs are advanced techniques players use to manipulate momentum and get an edge in fights. Let’s break down a few:
    Slide Jump: Run, crouch to slide, and jump at the end for a speed boost. Simple, right? This is the gateway drug of Apex movement—once you start, you can’t stop.
    Wall Jump: Run toward a wall, slide, jump into the wall, release all inputs to attach, then jump off. Easy to explain. Hard to execute without looking like you faceplanted.
    Super Glide: Climb a ledge, and as soon as you reach the top, press crouch and jump in the exact same frame. Yes, the exact frame.
But here’s the thing: mastering these mechanics feels amazing. The first time you pull off a wall jump to dodge an enemy's bullets, it feels like you just unlocked a cheat code.


*How It REALLY Feels to Play Apex Legends?

Apex Legends is... hard. Not "hard" like resisting Loba’s... assets. Hard like trying to do algebra while people shoot at you.
Let’s paint a picture:
You’re Timmy. You’re new. You’ve looted a few weapons, your teammate pings “enemies,” and you’re ready to prove yourself. Then, you see a short figure running toward you.
You aim and start shooting, but before you know it, the figure slides, jumps into a wall, then launches off it straight into your face.
(Cue clip of Timmy missing every shot while Wraith mains wall-jump into his face with a Mastiff.)
Knowing what a wall jump is wouldn’t have saved you—but it might’ve helped you prepare a little better (and avoid needing new pants).


*The Dark Side of Apex Legends

And here’s the truth: Apex has one of the steepest learning curves out there. The movement mechanics alone can make it feel like everyone else is a Jedi and you’re just trying to figure out how to hold a lightsabre.
But that’s also what makes it rewarding. Every match is a lesson. Every failed fight teaches you something new. And every time you finally pull off a wall jump, dodge bullets, or land your first Kraber headshot, it feels like a personal victory.
Yes, Apex Legends is hard—but it’s a good kind of hard. The kind that keeps you coming back for more. Because when everything clicks, and you’re sliding into battle like a hero from an action movie, there’s nothing else like it.

(End with a montage of epic plays and funny fails to upbeat music.)
